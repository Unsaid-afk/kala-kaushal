Project Brief: AI-Powered Sports Talent Assessment Platform
Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing an AI-powered mobile and web platform designed to democratize athletic talent assessment in India. The solution will leverage computer vision and machine learning to enable aspiring athletes to perform standardized fitness tests with a smartphone, providing personalized feedback and connecting them with scouts and opportunities.

Technical Stack
Mobile Frontend: React Native

Backend: Python (Flask or Django)

Database: PostgreSQL

AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch

Hosting: AWS/GCP (initial prototyping on Free Tier)

Module 1: Mobile App (React Native)
The mobile app is the primary interface for athletes. It must be fully responsive, support a localized and multilingual interface, and function in an offline-first mode.

1.1 Athlete Onboarding & Profile
User Registration: Implement a standard sign-up process.

Profile Creation: Allow athletes to create a profile with personal data (name, age, location), and upload biometric data (height, weight).

Localized Interface: The UI must be fully localized to support multiple regional Indian languages as a core feature.

1.2 AI-Powered Video Assessment
Video Recording: Develop a clean, intuitive video recording interface that guides the user on proper phone placement and test execution.

Test Selection: A list of standardized fitness tests (e.g., vertical jump, 100m sprint) that the AI can analyze.

Real-time Feedback (Digital Coach): The app should provide real-time, on-screen visual and auditory cues to guide the athlete on proper form and technique during the test.

Offline Functionality: Enable athletes to record and save videos even without an internet connection. Videos and data must be automatically queued for syncing once a connection is re-established.

1.3 Gamification & Engagement
Athlete Showcase: Create a digital portfolio for each athlete, automatically populated with verified test results and progress reports. This should be shareable.

Goal Tracking: Allow athletes to set and track personal performance goals.

Leaderboards & Achievements: Implement local and national leaderboards based on test scores. Integrate a system for earning badges and achievements for completing tests, reaching milestones, and showing consistent improvement.

Module 2: Backend & API (Python)
The backend will handle all data processing, storage, and AI model serving.

2.1 Core API Endpoints
User & Authentication API: Secure endpoints for athlete, scout, and organizational user management. Use a token-based authentication system.

Video Upload API: A robust endpoint to accept video files from the mobile app, with a queuing mechanism to handle uploads from offline devices.

Data API: Endpoints for CRUD operations on athlete profiles, test results, and training plans.

Search & Filter API: An API for the Mentor & Scout Dashboard that allows filtering athletes by multiple criteria (performance metrics, age, location, sport).

2.2 AI Model Integration
Video Processing Pipeline: Once a video is uploaded, trigger a background task to process it through the AI models.

AI-Powered Video Analysis:

Integrate a computer vision model to analyze the video and extract performance metrics (e.g., jump height, sprint time).

Integrate a pose estimation model to analyze form and biomechanics, providing feedback on technique.

AI-Powered Video Integrity: Implement a model to detect signs of digital manipulation or editing to ensure the authenticity of submissions.

Predictive Analytics: Develop a model to analyze an athlete's progress over time and national benchmarks to project future performance.

Module 3: Mentor & Scout Dashboard (Web)
This centralized dashboard is for sports authorities and scouts.

3.1 Dashboard Features
Secure Login: Access via a secure login for verified organizations and scouts.

Athlete Search: A powerful search interface with advanced filters based on metrics, location, age, and sport.

Athlete Profiles: Detailed view of each athlete's profile, including biometric data, test scores, progress charts, and AI-generated insights.

Highlights: A feature to highlight top-performing or most improved athletes based on predictive analytics.

3.2 Secure & Verified Features
Organizational Verification: Implement a robust verification scheme for sports organizations and scouts, possibly using multi-factor authentication.

Sponsorship & Scholarship Portal: An exclusive portal for scouts and sponsors to view and connect with top-performing athletes.

Module 4: Database Design (PostgreSQL)
Design a scalable relational database schema.

Users: Table for athletes, scouts, and organizations.

Profiles: Tables to store athlete biometric data, progress history, and digital portfolios.

Tests: Table for each standardized test, storing results, video metadata, and AI-generated insights.

Training Plans: Tables for customizable training plans and goal tracking.

Module 5: Additional Requirements
Security: Ensure all data is encrypted in transit and at rest. The verification and authentication system must be highly secure.

Scalability: The architecture should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and video uploads.

User Experience: The mobile app must have an intuitive and accessible UI, especially for users who may not be digitally native. The dashboard should be clear and easy to navigate for professionals.

Offline Data Sync: The app should manage a reliable data synchronization process, ensuring data integrity when the app moves between offline and online states.
